Istanbul’s mesmerizing allure and rich cultural heritage are a reflection of its diverse history and captivating charm.
As the city evolves and grows, it is imperative to preserve its essence and honour its past while creating a promising future.
Its streets are adorned with a plethora of objects, each holding a unique story that contributes to the city’s vibrant tapestry.
Every place, to some extent, can be remembered partly because it is unique, but partly because it has affected our consciousness and generated enough association to hold in it our personal worlds.
Human bodies, serving as a bridge between the tangible and visible realms, play a crucial role in constructing meaning and navigating the urban landscape.
A constant dialogue exists between the various elements that constitute the city, from objects on the streets to buildings and monuments, all imbued with layers of cultural, social, and historical stories.
As people interact with these elements, stories are exchanged, shaping the city’s identity and essence.
Actions, emotions, and existence are intertwined, creating a complex web of relationships.
Objects possess materiality, but at the same time they are cultural and imagined.
Cultural meanings encased inside aesthetically shaped material shells, objects trigger intense experience.
Throughout life’s journey, these objects become tangible markers that hold profound meanings, encapsulating treasured memories and reflecting the values that define individuals.
They enrich personal narratives, adding depth and significance to one’s experiences.
In Orhan Pamuk’s “The Museum of Innocence,” Kemal Basmaci, a wealthy Istanbul businessman, falls in love with his distant cousin, Fusun.
The novel revolves around a physical museum that Kemal creates to display objects associated with his relationship with Fusun.
These objects provide a glimpse into the characters’ lives, thoughts, and emotions.
The museum not only pays tribute to Kemal’s relationship with Fusun but also preserves Istanbul’s history.
Kemal collects objects that represent different periods in Istanbul’s history, creating a microcosm of the city that showcases its social and political changes over time.
Exploring these objects provides insight into the complexities of human emotion and the importance of cherishing our memories.
It encourages people to reflect on the value of their own experiences and the memories that make up their lives.
The objects in the museum symbolize Kemal and Fusun’s relationship, as well as broader themes such as the passage of time and the importance of memory.
As Istanbul transforms into a modern metropolis, Kemal struggles to reconcile his past with the new realities of the present.
The objects in the museum represent the preciousness of human experiences, each one with its own story and meaning.
They are not just static artifacts but fragments of individual experiences and memories.
It serves as a powerful reminder of the significance of preserving and celebrating our experiences.
Our encounters with the objects in the city are a way of interacting with the layers of human values instilled in them.
They are tangible markers, and their presence evokes compelling responses.
When one attempts to read the city through the objects on the streets, they transform themselves into story-telling devices and represent a collection of shared values and experiences.
They have the ability to paint a new picture of a place and enhance one’s experiences.
We settled down for a picnic on a meadow looking out at the view painted in this Antoine Ignace Melling (1763-1831) landscape.
I exhibit the thermos filled with tea, stuffed grape leaves, boiled eggs and some Meltem bottles to evoke our Sunday excursion that may offer the visitor some relief from the oppressive succession of interior settings, as well as my own agony.
But neither the reader nor the visitor should on any account think that I could forget my pain even for an instant.
Every man’s death begins with the death of his father.
My father’s death had turned all the familiar props of my childhood into objects of immeasurable value, each one the vessel of a lost past.
Happiness Means Being Close to the One You Love, That’s All.
The mementos preserve the colors, textures, and delights as they were more faithfully, in fact, than can those who accompanied us through those moments.
Digital tools were used to understand the street life and elements of Istanbul.
This includes various media like text, images, 3D models and videos.
“…one can easily see in an object at once a perfection and an absence of origin, a closure and a brilliance, a transformation of life into matter (matter is much more magical than life), and in a word a silence which belongs to the realm of fairy-tales.
The objects on the street contributed to how an urban space is perceived and experienced.
A list of objects that frequently appeared on the streets of Istanbul was put together to further explore.
Based on the curated object list, ArcGIS was used to find out what its distribution looked like and that in turn, gave a list of coordinates of these objects for further examination.
The ArcGIS coordinates were used to scrape out Google StreetView images.
200 images for each category of object were scraped in order to make an initial training dataset to perform object detection.
Each image was then labelled according to the different objects.
After training the images, the model was used to test the efficiency of the model.
A custom object detection model was trained based on a pre-trained model (YOLO).
The purpose of object detection was to understand the setting of the street objects.
Object Detection was performed on images scraped from Google Street view using the coordinates of the objects.
The images shown are the results of the custom trained detection model.
“There is no such thing as chance in a text.
Any text is the result of a repertoire, on conscious and unconscious levels, and can only be decoded by someone privy to the same repertoire.
Cities are not mere material entities; they become a text, inviting different interpretations and experiences, turning the urban landscape into a multidimensional book read by pedestrians and residents who construct their own meanings and narratives within it, continuously in time.
Each individual engages with the city from their unique perspective, constructing their space in the city with multiple meanings.
Books allow for more in-depth exploration of topics and themes, and often includes vivid descriptions of scenes and environments, allowing readers to envision the scenes and objects described in the text.
Objects within a scene can be used to convey important information about the setting or the characters themselves.
Different books related to Istanbul are scraped from various websites.
Each book is converted into a text file  and is broken down into sentences.
The list of objects and spaces is used as keywords to search through the corpus of sentences to obtain the best matching sentences in accordance to the similarity scores.
Each sentence is then labelled as an individual text file corresponding to the keyword.
The objects and space list are used as keywords and using the Skip-gram Word2Vec model, sentences that included both, the keyword and the most similar word to it are extracted and vectorised.
The TF-IDF model is used to extract features from these vectors and is used to train a Self-Organising Map (SOM).
SOM is used as a medium to find connections among clusters of objects and spaces.
All the cells represented on the SOM are the Best Matching Unit (BMU).
Each cell also contains several other sentences that are closely associated to the BMU.
“I paint objects as I think them, not as I see them”-Pablo Picasso.
Multiple 3D models are scraped out from SketchFab that gave a wide range of iterations of the same object.
The 3D model is used as an input and the processed text is used as the prompt in Stable diffusion.
Since these texts are in the context of Istanbul, the renders closely reflected iterations of the object that made them Istanbul-specific.
A model of the object is used as an input in Blender, and rendered using Stable Diffusion.
A single sentence from the sentences extracted is used as a prompt and “not Istanbul” is used as a negative prompt in the rendereing process.

While an orangery was planted on the lower level behind the kiosk of Mustafa Pasha, extending northward as far as the rectangular sunken marble pool.
Internally the kiosk is divided into three main rooms leading out of each other, the wall kiosk itself being part of the centre.
For instance, when facing the kiosk from the marble terrace we see that the arcade to the right, or garden side.
The 2nd Gate, Yali Kiosk Ka- pust, is named after the handsome kiosk of Suleiman the Magnificent.

When you have bathed there a few times, when you have walked along the shore in the quiet evening under a parasol, breathing the exquisite air, when you have dined in a cafe of old Phalerum built out into the sea.
Along  the  middle  of  the  street, these  Oriental  fingers  and  arms  carried  no  weightier burden  than  a  parasol  or  an  infant.
Holding his  musket  all  on  one  side,  (as  they  always  do),  and when  bored,  tossing  it  about  as  a  school-girl  does  her parasol.
This was all the more distressing to three or four European ladies who were there, because etiquette forbids the opening of a parasol in presence of the Sultan.
The high colour that distinguishes each individual, and the parasol which inevitably accompanies street dress.

Light up all this with a brilliant sunshine, place here and there in these streets filled with light a few long-veiled senoras who hold their open fan against their cheek by way of a parasol.
Thesun is implacable and oppressive, despite her parasol, and it is awful tohave to spend so much time sitting upright when her natural propensityis for the horizontal.
Objects within a space have the power to shape its character, and when they are strategically placed and thoughtfully curated, they can greatly enhance the emotional response of those who inhabit it.
Incorporating dynamic and interactive elements into these objects not only introduces an element of surprise but also elevates users’ experiences by infusing the space with a sense of excitement and novelty.
They go beyond their utilitarian purposes to embody cultural significance and collective memory.
“The city is a theater, a stage where we perform our lives.
Objects and experiences become the props and scripts we use to create our own individual dramas.
The heart of the project lies in the curation of these objects.
By recognizing their current attributes and associations, they are reimagined with additional semantic information.
This curated approach allows to design spaces that resonate with the essence of Istanbul and its people.
The aim is to transform ordinary, mundane spaces into vibrant living rooms of the city, that narrate stories of its people.
Objects cease to be passive observers of the city; they become active participants in shaping how people experience and perceive their surroundings.
General Asim Gundu Street in Kadikoy, located on the Asian side of Istanbul is considered as the site of exploration.
The street is reconstructed using photogrammetry by using a walking tour video as the source for extracting 3D information.
The reconstructed mesh is taken as the base and associated with the space in real-time.
The custom-trained object detection model is used to detect objects that exist in the location.
Objects like fountain, storefront, awning, bench and balcony are detected.
The SOM trained on objects and space list is used as a design tool.
The cells containing fountain as the keyword are narrowed down and the most connected cell ( lightest colored cell ) is chosen.
All associated sentences within the cell are further processed using PCA.
Based on the links established in PCA, sentences are put together to form a combined sentence, which is used as a prompt.

[1] So at the center of the külliye he placed his mosque and tomb, known today as Fatih Camii.
[2] The mosque was founded in the early sixteenth century by Ahi Çelebi ibni Kemal, chief physician at the hospital of Fatih’s külliye.
Different 3D Models of fountain are scraped from Sketchfab which are used to re-imagine it using Stable Diffusion on Blender.
The resulting images are combined to generate a single image, using Image Mixer Model, that emphasizes the important features of each version of the fountain.
Shap-E , a model that generates 3D objects using text and images as input, is used to produce a point cloud model and a mesh model based on the combined image.
This process is carried out for all other objects in the location.
The reimagined versions of the objects are inserted back into the street.
Using Segment - Anything, Image segmentation is carried out to understand the extent of the influence of the objects.
The objects along with the segments are looked into individually.

Indeed, as I see it now, the way it appeared to my child’s eye, it is not a building, but it is quite dissolved and distributed inside me: here, one room, there another, and here a bit of corridor which, however, does not connect the two rooms, but is conserved in me in fragmentary form.
Thus, the whole thing is scattered about inside me, the rooms, the stairs that descend with such ceremonious slowness, others, narrow cages that mounted in a spiral movement in the darkness of which we advance like the blood in our veins.
